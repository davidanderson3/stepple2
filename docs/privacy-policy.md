# Stepple Privacy Policy

_Last updated: October 2024_

Stepple collects and uses a minimal set of personal information so that you can view your activity progress and share it with friends. We never sell data to advertisers or other third parties.

## Information We Collect

- **Step data** – Daily step counts read from Health Connect (Android) and the Activity Recognition permission.  
- **Profile data** – Optional display name and Stepple user ID generated in the app.  
- **Diagnostic data** – Crash reports, analytics, and device information that help us troubleshoot issues.

## How We Use Information

- Display your daily and historical step totals.  
- Power the Stepple leaderboard so invited friends can compare progress.  
- Improve application stability and performance.

## Sharing and Disclosure

- Step data is only visible to you and friends you explicitly invite.  
- We never sell or rent personal data.  
- We may disclose data if required by law or to protect the rights and safety of our users.

## Storage and Security

- Step counts are cached locally on your device and synced to Stepple’s Firebase/Firestore backend using encrypted connections.  
- Access to Firestore is authenticated and audited.  
- We follow industry practices to protect data, but no method of storage is 100 % secure.

## Your Choices & Data Control

- Revoke Health Connect permissions at any time inside the Health Connect app.  
- Delete your Stepple data from within the app (Settings → Delete Account) or email us at privacy@stepple.com.  
- Contact us for an export or deletion request at any time.

## Children’s Privacy

Stepple is not directed to children under 13. If we learn we’ve collected data from a child under 13, we’ll delete it immediately on request.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy. New versions will be posted at this URL with an updated “Last updated” date. Continued use of Stepple after an update means you accept the new policy.
